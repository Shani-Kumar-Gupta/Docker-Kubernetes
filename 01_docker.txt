Container is the instance of an image

// Essential Docker Functions and Commands:

// Port Mapping and Logs
Problem: Our Docker images is up and running but we are still unable to access it through localhost. 
When we run localhost on browser what happening here is the browser is sending the request to port number 80 to our host machine.
