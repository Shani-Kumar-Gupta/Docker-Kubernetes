As of now, we are using existing docker images from docker hub to ship our application.
But what is you can to ship and bind your dependencies to the application.

Where dockerfile comes into the picture- used to create custom images
--> Create Dockerfile in your application
--> Dockerfile consist of the line of code needs to be executed
--> first line -> need to tell docker about the base image
--> Add configuration
--> Run below command
  - docker build -t image_name directory_name
--> Run the images now with the same command.
